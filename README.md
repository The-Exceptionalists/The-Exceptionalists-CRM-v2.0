into opportunities and many more features!

## Usage

The application starts with a fancy layout where a list of many the commands is shown in a window at the right side. The
rest can be found if your write the command help.

The central window will contain the information of the objects the user wants to check, while the window at the bottom
will prompt the required values in some of the operations.

**The navigation system in this project is pretty straight-forward:** the user has to enter a command from the list, and
the application will prompt the user with the required values while specifying them in the prompt window. Each time the
user enters an incorrect command or incorrect value, the user will be informed and asked to enter the command or value
correctly.
